# Upcoming features to develop

## Profile
Customers need a profile page to see all their current information. They will also be able to request to change their information in this page. It also would be nice if they can access to view all their current order, and maybe show the order progress.

## Payment 
Payment page needs to be added as a final step after confirming delivery information. However, due to security problem, this feature was not developed, might consider to implement any third party payment system.

## Image copyright
Need to make sure all images are our own, or from open-sources

## Deployment
Need to deploy to the company server, which is IIS. Currently haven't found any solutions to deploy SSR Nextjs to IIS server.

## Sitemap 
After deployment feature is done, pay attention when submitting sitemap to google. The static sitemap is normally good to go, but somehow google cannot fetch server-sitemap, although test live url always works well
